Simple app for my daughter's class project to display the mood of a person based on social media posts

Right now the app uses hard coded values to display the chart. It is meant to display a concept for her class presentation. It does not integrate with social media accounts. The plan would be to integrate with them. Then integrate a machine learning model (NLP) that predicts the mood of the post.
